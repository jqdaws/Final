    <p>1998-2016</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Iowa City, IA. My dad is a professor at the University of Iowa so I lived there as I was growing up. My family did move once while I was living there, but it was just a few houses down the road. I really liked growing up in Iowa</p>
    <p class="states">Sweden</p>
    <p>2016-2018</p>
    <p>I lived in Sweden for two years as a missionary for my church. I moved a bit while I was there. In total I lived in 5 different cities over the two years. It was a really fun time as I got to meet a lot of new people and learn the language and culture. </p>

    <p>After living in Sweden for two years I moved to Utah for school. I am currently attending BYU and studying finance. I love living in Utah since it has a lot of outdoor things to do.</p>

    <p>I love playing Pickleball and know a lot of people have played. However, I don't think too many people have seen professionals play. Here's a clip of two of the top players playing a match.</p>

    <p>
        I'm lucky to have grown up in a very loving home. My parents were and are great rolemodels for me.
        My three older siblings were also great examples to me and have inspired me a lot. My oldest sister
        is currently getting her PhD from the University of Utah in Biology. My brother is working for Google
        in Seattle and my other sister is working at Arizona State University. I recently got married at the
        beginning of November 2022. I love being married and can't wait to see where life takes us. My wife
        recently showed me an infographic about who we spend our time with as we age. I was able to find a 
        tableau graphic and include it below.
